# Series Scraper for s.to

### Description

This script is a web scraper that extracts information about movies and TV shows from a website called "s.to". The extracted data includes the title, season number, episode number, and the date when the episode was watched.

The script was mainly generated by using ChatGPT, a GPT-2 based chatbot that can generate code from natural language. The script was then modified to work with the s.to website.

### Requirements

* Node.js and npm
* A s.to account

### Usage

To use this script, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
cd YOUR-REPOSITORY
```
2. Install the required dependencies using npm.

```
npm install
```
3. Create a **\`.env`** file in the root directory of the project, and add the following variables with your own values:
``` makefile
PAGE_USERNAME=your_username
PAGE_PASSWORD=your_password

HEADLESS=true
DONT_LOAD_STYLES=true
DO_SCREENSHOTS=false
```

**\`PAGE_USERNAME:`** your username on the s.to website.

**\`PAGE_PASSWORD:`** your password on the s.to website.

**\`HEADLESS:`** whether or not to run the browser in headless mode.

**\`DONT_LOAD_STYLES:`** whether or not to block unnecessary resources such as stylesheets and fonts to speed up page loading.

**\`DO_SCREENSHOTS:`** whether or not to take a screenshot of the logged in page.

4. Run the script using the following command:
``` bash
npm run start
```

5. The script will start running and will output the data to a file in the dist directory called output.json. If the 
DO_SCREENSHOTS variable is set to true, screenshots of the login page and each scraped page will also be saved in the dist directory.
Note: The script will stop after scraping the first X pages, where X is the value of the firstXPages variable in the script. If you want to scrape all pages, set this variable to 0.
